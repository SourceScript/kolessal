# kolessal

A simple collection of css utilities written in LESS, generally adheres to [RSCSS](https://github.com/rstacruz/rscss).

### Less Boilerplate

These days we don't use Twitter Bootstrap or any fancy CSS frameworks anymore. Actually, we've stopped writing CSS due to the transition to inline-styles. **kolessal** provides us a small collection of helpful utilities to aid our design (instead of writing certain styling everytime).

### Small

**kolessal** is very small &mdash; weighing `~1kb` when minified.

## Why the name?

A play with words with "colossal" (which *ironically* means large) and "less" (the preprocessor used, and also deducts the significance of the word *colossal*) -> ko**less**al. *ba dum tss*.

The first-letter *c* was turned to *k* for `++swag`.
