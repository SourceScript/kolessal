# Contribution

Please feel free to submit an issue for any inquiries, questions, or for whatever. Pull-requests are very much appreciated!

## Coding Style

This simple utility collection generally adheres to RSCSS.

## Building

This is generally for contributors, but also for anyone who wants to whatever (although it makes little no sense). Setting up is easy as cloning, and then running some no-brainer stuff.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sourcescript/kolessal.git

# Installs dependencies and also compiles our less file
$ make

# Compiles our less file
$ make build
```

You're good to go!
